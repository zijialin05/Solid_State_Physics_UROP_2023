This is the simulation for the control test with the vortex layer only

The approach I used was to delete the under layer by setting its thickness to 0,
change the thickness of the upper layer to 30 nm, and make it a vortex (ACW)

The reason for this is that whenever I tried to delete the upper layer, the program raised an error

I hope this works the same.

Please LMK if there is a problem
